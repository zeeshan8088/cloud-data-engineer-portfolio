# Week 1 Review – Cloud Data Engineering Foundations

What I learned this week:
- How modern data pipelines are structured end-to-end
- Difference between batch, event-driven, and real-time ingestion
- Role of Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, and BigQuery
- Importance of raw data layers and decoupled systems

Key mental models:
- Ingestion can change; analytics should not
- Events trigger pipelines, not humans
- Messaging decouples systems for scalability

Confidence gained:
- I can explain a full data pipeline clearly
- I understand where BigQuery fits
- I am no longer confused by cloud buzzwords
