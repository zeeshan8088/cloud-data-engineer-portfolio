# Day 1 – BigQuery Sandbox & GCP Orientation

What I did:
- Used Google Cloud BigQuery in sandbox mode (no billing)
- Ran SQL queries on public datasets
- Created my own dataset and table
- Loaded CSV data into BigQuery
- Queried cloud data successfully

What I learned:
- BigQuery is serverless
- Data is schema-based
- Cloud SQL works at scale without managing servers

Why this matters:
BigQuery is widely used in modern data engineering pipelines for analytics and reporting.
