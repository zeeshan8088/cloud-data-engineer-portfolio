# Day 4 – Pub/Sub & Real-Time Pipelines

What I learned:
- Pub/Sub is a messaging system
- Producers send messages to topics
- Subscribers process messages independently
- Pub/Sub decouples systems for scalability

Real-time data flow:
- Event occurs (order placed)
- Message published to topic
- Subscriber processes message
- Data is loaded into BigQuery

Why this matters:
Real-time pipelines handle high-volume, fast data without breaking systems.
